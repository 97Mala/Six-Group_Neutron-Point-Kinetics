  ----------------- Neutron Point Kinetics simulation code -----------------    

Six Group of delayed neutron precursors implemented

It hence deal with a stiff problem due to the differences in evolution time scale between prompt and delayed neutron.

  MAIN FILES INDEX

main.py   -> main program, performs the simulation and saves the csv with the results as well as the outcoming plots

KINmodule -> module containing the definition of the problem and the function to be implemented in order to solve the problem

KINnt     -> .png file with the outcoming neutron population time profile

KINct     -> .png file with the outcoming set of precursors group profile
